Full-time remote work is possible. As a general rule, requests to work remotely will usually be allowed for locations that are within three hours of the Pacific Time Zone. Exceptions to the time zone rule may be made in rare circumstances.\n\nFlexibility: We support and encourage flexible working, including flexible hours, regular work-from-home days, part-time work patterns, and periodic remote-work stints. The majority of our staff, including senior management, work flexibly in one way or another.\n\nVisa sponsorship: We can sponsor work visas. However, please be aware that processing times can be much longer than usual right now and are subject to specific country circumstances. Currently, international remote work is possible.\n\nTimeline: We're reviewing applications on a rolling basis.\nAbout GiveWell\n\nGiveWell is motivated by the simple question: how can we do as much good as possible?\n\nIn our efforts to answer this question, our researchers search for and recommend outstanding philanthropic giving opportunities. We focus on global health and poverty alleviation programs in the lowest-income parts of the world because that is where we've found we can have the greatest impact, according to our criteria.\n\nWe direct funding to outstanding giving opportunities in two main ways:\n• Our recommended charities. We rigorously vet and recommend a short list of top charities that meet our criteria of being evidence-backed, cost-effective, transparent, and in need of more funding. Our nine current top charities work on death-averting (malaria chemoprevention, antimalarial nets, vaccine incentivization, and vitamin A supplementation) and life-improving (providing cash transfers and deworming medication) programs.\n• We continuously review our giving recommendations, and this analysis is available, for free, on our website. Based on our recommendations, donors have given more than $800 million to our recommended programs since our founding in 2007. In 2020 alone, GiveWell donors contributed more than $170 million to our recommendations, which we estimate will avert between 29,000 and 48,000 deaths and provide parasitic worm treatments for over 12 million children.\n• * Grants to promising opportunities. GiveWell also recommends grants to projects whose impact is less directly measurable but might be even greater than that of our recommended charities. Past grants include support for an initiative to improve the uptake and implementation by governments of evidence-based policy and the first randomized controlled trial of mask-wearing in a low-income country to increase mask use and prevent COVID-19 transmission.\n\nGoing forward, we expect to broaden the scope of what we consider funding. We will remain driven by our search for funding opportunities that can save or improve lives the most.\nThe role\n\nSenior Researchers at GiveWell are the intellectual leaders who guide our exploration of how we can do the most good. In this role, you will be responsible for finding, researching, and ultimately recommending high-impact or potentially high-impact giving opportunities. As part of a small team, you will be a significant contributor to our decisions about how hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent with the goal of saving and improving the lives of people living in the lowest-income communities in the world.\n\nYou will be a leader on our research team, conducting research to help us identify outstanding programs to recommend. Examples of questions Senior Researchers have worked on recently include:\n• What is the impact of building footbridges in rural communities?\n• What should we believe about the impacts of improved water quality on all-cause mortality?\n• How can we model the general equilibrium effects of cash transfers?\n\nIn addition to the core work of identifying outstanding programs, Senior Researchers own messy and complicated questions that inform our analysis, such as:\n• How can we improve our approach to cost-effectiveness modeling?\n• How should we use pooled impact estimates from a highly heterogeneous evidence base?\n• How should we prioritize programs that reduce poverty relative to programs that reduce deaths? What is the moral value of each outcome?\n• How should we think about the opportunity cost of other actors’ contributions to programs we fund?\n\nOur Senior Researchers leverage a combination of critical research review and synthesis, empirical analysis, modeling, logical reasoning, and good judgment in order to make practical recommendations on a topic.\nAbout you\n\nSenior Researchers typically have a quantitatively oriented advanced degree and/or substantive relevant experience. They also have the intellectual flexibility to tackle a wide range of questions such as those listed above.\n\nWe expect you will be characterized by many of the below qualities. We encourage you to apply if you would use the majority of these characteristics to describe yourself:\n• You are passionate about helping improve global health and alleviate global poverty as much as possible.\n• You are highly skilled at critically analyzing and synthesizing empirical research and understanding how a body of evidence may apply to real-world problems.\n• You are able to plan an efficient approach to exploring complicated questions, including identifying and focusing on the most decision-relevant aspects of a project.\n• You consider the big picture, asking questions like: is this project appropriately formulated and the best use of my time? What is GiveWell getting wrong in our research?\n• You clearly communicate what you believe and why, as well as what you are uncertain about.\n• You ask a lot of questions, and are curious, rather than defensive, when interrogating your own or others’ work.\n• You are able to execute research that holds up under scrutiny from others and over time.\n• You are respectful, effective, and efficient in your interactions with colleagues as well as external parties.\n\nConfidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. Here’s a secret: there's no such thing as a \"perfect\" candidate. GiveWell is looking for exceptional people who want to make a positive impact through their work and help create an organization where everyone can thrive. So whatever background you bring with you, please apply if this role would make you excited to come to work every day.\nTo apply\n\nApply here: http://www.givewell.org/about/jobs/research-application. We only accept applications through our website. You may also send additional materials, such as a letter of recommendation, to support your application; this is not required. Please send those materials to jobs@givewell.org.\n\nWe plan to respond to all submissions. Please contact jobs@givewell.org with any questions.\n\nIf you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, you may contact us at jobs@givewell.org.\n\nAs part of our dedication to the diversity of our staff, GiveWell is committed to the principles of Equal Employment Opportunity and to making employment decisions based on merit and value.

Utilizing these scenario analyses, a tool for risk assessment of flooding will be generated. The goal is to ultimately create a process to assess flooding risk with a changing climate at different installations or cities.

      "job_description": "Development Informatics\n\nHuman-Centered Digital Transformation\n\nSCOPE OF WORK\n\nCONSULTANT NAME:\n\nPOSITION TITLE:\n\nTOTAL LEVEL OF EFFORT:\n\nTBD\n\nHuman Centered Digital Transformation Researcher\n\n70 days\n\nAGREEMENT NAME:\n\nAGREEMENT NUMBER:\n\nBUY-IN ACTIVITY:\n\nDigital Frontiers\n\nAID-OAA-A-17-00033\n\nInformatics\n\nPERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:\n\nEVALUATOR:\n\nJuly-October 2023\n\nPriya Sethi\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nUSAID’s Digital Societies and Governments (formerly Development Informatics team) Team’s vision is to empower people, communities, and governments to achieve better development outcomes through a more equitable, digitally-enabled world. We work to advance inclusive and resilient societies by collaborating with stakeholders to build knowledge and address emerging risks and opportunities in data governance and digital government.\n\nUSAID and the broader development community seek clearer ways to understand and address how digital transformation impacts humanity, especially when those impacts cross traditional development sectors and different populations. The development community needs a better way to understand the impact of technology designs, and in the decision making, governance, and the use of data for all humans.\n\nOne potential approach is what the Agency is tentatively calling Human Centered Digital Transformation. This approach builds on social justice, digital transformation, and human rights conversations that are taking place within and outside of the digital development sphere. The Agency would like to learn more about these dialogues and from communities that have different perspectives on this topic (eg. social justice, feminism & technology, social philosophy, data governance). The Agency also recognizes that different sectors may have used this approach in ways that we can learn from, especially in democracy, human rights, philosophy, governance, education technology, digital health, and digital agriculture. How are people defining human-centered digital transformation, and adjacent terms? What are different approaches? What should the Agency apply in our programming? How may these perspectives help the development community refocus digitalization efforts towards human and societal well being?\n\nThis research is intended to reflect a shift: that the landscape for digital development has changed. In the past, development practitioners asked “how can digital interventions help achieve better development outcomes”? It was assumed that digital interventions were, at worst, benign, and at best, supportive of values such as inclusion and well-being for all. Yet, digital transformation opened opportunities for harm alongside benefits. These harms include phishing, abusive behaviors, and mis/dis-information. Digital transformation has amplified existing power dynamics, elite capture, and alienation, while divides in power mean that some, often those already vulnerable, cannot meaningfully shape how this transformation impacts them. Emerging technologies such as generative AI create further unknowns.\n\nAfter experiencing the past three decades of digital transformation in the world, the development community is asking: “How is digital transformation impacting humanity? Are there human-centered digital transformation approaches that can shape a better world for all? The shift sounds subtle, but it reflects a growing awareness that the benefits and risks of digital transformation have not been evenly distributed. This shift has incredible implications for USAID’s work. The development community needs better ways to – at a minimum - Do No Harm - and ideally, make investments that - Do Better - to improve development outcomes across a broad swath of people.\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nDigital Frontiers seeks a consultant to define human-centered digital transformation (or alternative term), what it means for the Agency’s mission, and how it can be applied to further the Agency’s work in digital development. The Agency is seeking a research paper and a vision to consider in future Technology Division work, primarily focused on the Digital Societies and Governments Team’s portfolio in digital government and data governance. This activity will help USAID position itself in the broader discussions, work, and efforts in the development and digital landscape and improve the Agency’s understanding how it can best move forward. The outputs will provide USAID with the outcome of foundational knowledge, including:\n• Key definitions of human-centered digital transformation and related terms, for a USAID and public audience.\n• Landscaping of other actors engaged in this space, key initiatives, associated risks and challenges of approaches, and existing resources, for a USAID and public audience.\n• Summary of what can be gained from this approach by the communities we work with and a vision/call to action for the international development community (to be defined iteratively with the consultant - but grounded in the articulated needs/desires/cautions of the countries and populations we work with) for how investing in human-centered digital transformation can support USAID’s and other major actors’ work (eg. in different sectors, regions, and USAID initiatives); and\n• Recommendations for how donors/key development actors, including USAID, can integrate human centered digital transformation into their work, including potential engagement with broader stakeholders (eg. how the development community can/should engage other stakeholders such as technology companies, civil society, governing bodies, and technology investors).\n\nTASKS\n\n1. Develop Inception Report\n\nThis inception report should be completed a few weeks after the project start, after preliminary conversations with the team and high-level document review, to reflect the final approach agreed to with USAID at the start of the work. The report should include:\n• Outline of research protocol\n• Summary understanding of purpose, rationale, and goals of the research.\n• Research approach\n• Key research questions to be answered\n• Identified and proposed data sources (such as document review, survey, interviews, sampling, etc.) for the key research questions\n• Proposed data collection instruments\n• Proposed analysis approach\n\n2. Develop comprehensive research report with reference materials\n\nThe Research Report will include findings on existing definitions and discussion on how “human-centered digital transformation” or related terms are being used, by whom, and considerations for a definition. The deliverable will include the following, plus a high-level summary slide deck for external audiences:\n• Landscape analysis and discussion, to include 3-5 illustrative examples of human-centered digital transformation in action, 3-5 illustrative examples of digital transformation that is not .human-centered\n• Summary of 20-25 key informant interviews and focus group discussions\n• Literature inventory to identify common terms and frameworks within and beyond USAID/USG, the development community, academia, and civil society.\n• Organizations and Contacts inventory to identify key points of contact and organizations relevant to USAID, disaggregated by role, sector, and influence\n• Definitions inventory to demonstrate how this term is being defined, by whom, adjacent terms and definitions\n• Examples inventory to include examples of human-centered digital transformation with citations\n• Key Informant Interview questions and findings for review and input by USAID and consultant\n\n3. Draft Vision Paper\n\nThe draft Vision paper will include the definition and vision for the international development community with high level summary of research findings and recommendations. The deliverable will be a paper and slide deck for review and approval by USAID.\n\n4. Host Vision Workshop\n\nThe consultant is asked to co-host up to five 55-minute workshops with USAID staff to validate the definition, vision, and recommendations for USAID. USAID will schedule these workshops, organize invitations and registration, and co-host with the consultant, using USAID systems. The consultant will facilitate workshops with USAID key stakeholders, lead presentations on the research and vision, facilitate discussion amongst attendees, and capture feedback for incorporation into the Final Vision Paper.\n\n5. Draft Final Vision Paper and Slides\n\nThe vision paper will be validated during workshops, and revisions identified in those workshops will be incorporated by the consultant into the final version. The consultant will not be responsible for final copy editing and graphic design of the document, although the consultant should deliver drafts that are accessible and readable.\n\nDELIVERABLES\n\nDeliverable 1: Inception report (google doc/sheets)\n\nDeliverable 2: Research Report, including Inventories\n\nDeliverable 3: Draft Vision paper\n\nDeliverable 4: Vision Workshop\n\nDeliverable 5: Final Vision paper and slides\n\nDeliverables should be submitted with Google products\n\nDeliverables may result in internal and external versions of the reports and related materials. Plain language (see plainlanguage.gov) should be closely considered (e.g. imperialism casting, translation impacts, reading level, accessibility) in drafts of deliverables. The use of visuals/diagrams, stories, and examples to illustrate key concepts are encouraged.\n\nDigital Frontiers will provide final graphic design, copy editing, and 508 compliance.\n\nTIMEFRAME AND LOE\n\nThe estimated timeframe is from July-October 2023. The estimated level of effort is 70 days.\n\nLocation: May be based anywhere but must be available to overlap with EST time zone for weekly meetings.\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• The consultant should come from a USAID partner country and/or have grounded and relevant experience working in USAID partner countries.\n• The consultant should use cross-sectoral approaches, including awareness of potential different definitions or priorities by sector, but ideally seek holistic approaches that are sector agnostic.\n• The consultant should prioritize key informant interviews and resources sourced from LMICs when performing this work.\n• Excellent English written and oral communication skills\n• Excellent research skills with proven ability to summarize large volumes of information in a concise, digestible report that is accessible for international development practitioners and policy staff that are unfamiliar with digital development",
