      "job_description": "Fall Term (September 2023 - December 2023), full-time work schedule, Monday- Friday 40 hours per week\n\nCisco Meraki Business Unit\n\nThe modern world runs on the Internet, and the Internet cannot exist without its underlying i nfrastructure. Meraki makes setting up, managing, and maintaining that infrastructure easier than it has ever been before. Meraki enables connectivity everywhere from neighborhood cafes to education institutions to global hospitality groups operating thousands of sites.\n\nAs a Full Stack Engineer at Meraki, you will help craft and build features for Meraki's Dashboard - the window to the entire Meraki experience. From Dashboard, our customers can control their entire Meraki stack: access points, switches, firewalls, client devices, cameras, and more. You will work across the stack with other developers, UX designers, and product management to build and improve the Dashboard web application. Meraki engineers put the customer experience first, own projects from beginning to end, and are empowered to make impactful decisions.\n\nMeraki believes that the quality of our product is dependent on the quality of our engineers. We place a high value on nurturing the growth and development of everyone on our team. We foster an open and supportive workplace where everybody is given the opportunity to succeed.\n\nExample projects of a Full Stack Web Developer Intern:\n• Create services to fetch data from millions of Meraki devices, then present that data in a user-friendly way\n• Improve performance and efficiency of our backend, allowing us to handle increasingly large datasets with minimal delay\n• Build internal frameworks and refine front end infrastructure to augment developer productivity\n• Construct API endpoints to allow Meraki users and third party companies to build custom tools and features\n• Build a dashboard for anomaly / outlier detection on network traffic using machine learning algorithms\n• Build a graph for network traffic analysis using clustering and other algorithms\n\nYou are an outstanding applicant if:\n• You are pursuing a technical bachelors degree or have equivalent experience with a strong foundation in the fundamentals of computer science -OR- pursuing a software/codin g boot camp (or educational training program) and/or technical associates degree with a strong foundation in the fundamentals of computer science. Individuals who have completed the relevant networking boot camp within the last 6 months will be considered\n• You strive to build rich and dynamic web applications with front-end frameworks such as React, Redux, Ember, or Angular\n• You are familiar with programming languages and web frameworks like Ruby (Rails, EventMachine), Python (Django, Flask), or Node.js (Express)\n• You have worked with SQL and relational Databases\n• You would flourish within a small engineering team and are excited to tackle open-ended problems\n• Authorized to work in the U.S. without requiring sponsorship now or in the future *Individuals pursuing a master's degree will not be considered\n\nIntern Program Overview:\n\nMeraki interns and co-ops join the team for 12 and 16 week programs, respectively, and are placed directly onto subteams. During the program, interns/co-ops have the opportunity to work on a small starter project, such as integration and implementation of new tools, before spending the majority of the program on a larger project, such as building the infrastructure for a new service. Projects are cross functional, which allow insight into new languages and technologies, help encourage professional growth within engineering, and allow a sense of ownership within the team.\n\nMeraki's engineering teams place a high emphasis on mentorship. Each intern and co-op is matched 1:1 with a mentor who provides continual feedback and guidance throughout the duration of the program. Mentors help with introductions to other team members, overviews of tools and processes, and provide a seamless integration into Meraki life.\n\nIntern Benefits:\n• Housing Assistance\n• Competitive salary\n• Weekly social events inside and outside of the office (Giants games, Exploratorium tickets, friendly soccer games)\n• Lunch and dinner daily\n• Customized laptop and desk setups\n• Medical coverage plan\n\nCisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis. Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\nAt Cisco Meraki, we're challenging the status quo with the power of diversity, inclusion, and collaboration. When we connect different perspectives, we can imagine new possibilities, inspire innovation, and release the full potential of our people. We're building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.\n\nMESSAGE TO APPLICANTS APPLYING TO WORK IN THE U.S.:\n\nWhen available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.\n\nU.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.\n\nEmployees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.\n\nRemote: Yes",

      "job_description": "Company Description\n\nNava partners with government to deliver mission-critical software that helps public institutions earn people's trust. As a public benefit corporation, Nava is driven not just by profit, but also by our mission to build government software that well serves the American public. We ask the right questions to help civil servants and other contractors work effectively on complex systems in multi-stakeholder environments.\n\nYou will work on an integrated cross-functional team to support ongoing modernization efforts for the Medicare Claims ecosystem. This work includes determining how to modernize legacy systems, implement DevOps best practices, and promote agile practices.\n\nJob Description\n\nOpportunities and Challenges\n\nYou will be working within the government ecosystem, which means working, sometimes closely, with other government contractors and civil servants. Working with people outside of your company means you'll likely encounter different working styles and cultural norms. At the same time, working as part of a larger team allows us to deliver on projects of larger scale and complexity.\n\nThe government also imposes a level of bureaucracy that is typically not present in a company of our size in the private sector. We operate in a regulated environment, where checks and compliance is built into the process of building software. This can make the path to production slower and some decisions, such as tools and processes, lie outside of our control. However, beyond writing code, finding and recommending ways to improve the way government software is built is one of the highest-leverage ways we help fulfill our mission.\n\nYou will be working with legacy systems. While our work is to build new systems with up-to-date technology, we have to do that within an existing ecosystem. Our work is building functional, resilient software for production. We don't build flashy prototypes that don't work for real people. This usually means getting to know legacy systems, often with poor documentation and unreliable narrators, and trying to determine how to replicate the systems' behavior or how to integrate with these systems. This is a great opportunity for engineers who enjoy software archaeology. If you care deeply about how software systems work over time, and building systems for longevity and resilience, this work is for you.\n\nWho we’re looking for\n\nYou are a reliable, experienced engineer who cares deeply about building software that makes a real difference in people's lives, and is keen to grapple with the complexities and trade-offs involved in building government software. You prefer using proven technologies to build well-designed systems that are scalable, performant, and secure.\n\nYou enjoy working on cross-functional teams, and collaborating with others, and you are able to direct yourself and work independently. You have empathy for the people who rely on your work, and you care about how your behavior affects others. You are humble and you value critical feedback and personal growth. You are comfortable receiving and giving kind, candid feedback.\n\nBeyond coding ability, communication and teamwork skills are paramount. You must be able to communicate clearly and professionally in writing, in person, and through online tools, especially because we work with government stakeholders and other contractors.\n\nYou exhibit good judgment and able to adapt to new situations well. You may encounter situations that no one on your team or at Nava has encountered before. You take responsibility and are able to persist through ambiguity to get to a solution.\n\nQualifications\n\nRequirements\n• 2+ years experience developing software in a team environment, preferably building medium to large-scale systems.\n• Experience with modern web development frameworks.\n• Experience designing and implementing application architectures and code that is highly scalable, available, and performant.\n• Self-directed, requiring minimal supervision.\n\nResponsibilities\n• Collaborate with the product team, government stakeholders, and other contractors to build new systems and make improvements to existing systems.\n• Design and spec out major functionality.\n• Participate in planning and breaking down requirements into tasks.\n• Maintain production systems, handle on-call duties, and systematically debug and resolve issues when they occur.\n• Review code and give feedback on technical specs.\n• Make improvements by proposing new tools and practices.\n\nThings that are not important to us\n• Whether or not you have a CS or engineering degree (or any degree).\n• Whether or not you have Github contributions. (It's great if you do, but we don't expect it.)\n• Whether or not you have worked at a well-recognized company.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nWe're a small team working to radically improve our government, so everyone that joins us has a direct impact on the direction and success of Nava. We are stewards – we hold a deep responsibility towards the systems that we work with. We are a community – we value collaboration both within our teams and with the many hardworking people within government. We offer generous benefits and equity.\n\nWe care deeply about diversity and inclusion at Nava. We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\n\nNote that we participate in E-Verify and upon hire, will provide the federal government with your Form I-9 information to confirm that you are authorized to work in the U.S.\n\nApply at https://jobs.lever.co/nava/7f427c2d-c29f-4598-a449-65d3f4d8b2ee/apply",

      "job_description": "ABOUT RETOOL:\n\nAt Retool, we’re changing the way software is built. We’ve developed the fastest way to build internal tools, saving companies time, resources, and engineering bandwidth. Whether it’s refunding orders, underwriting loans, managing marketplaces, rolling out new features, analyzing transactions, or providing customer support, Retool makes it dramatically faster and easier to build internal tools that teams need. We believe that the future of software development lies in being a force multiplier for developers and technical builders, helping them move considerably faster building a lot more software. We’re looking for highly collaborative people as we build a world-class team to support this mission and we’d love for you to join us!\nWHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU\n\nRetool started as a way to address obstacles with internal tools and has grown into a company that solves internal tooling for thousands of companies (big and small). We’ve done a lot with a little–we have a growing engineering team and a laundry list of features and foundational improvements we want to tackle.\n\nTo continue our fast-paced growth, we need to build a world-class engineering team. You’ll help us get there by owning end-to-end projects, talking with customers, and ultimately supporting the growth of Retool the product and the business.\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\nWe’re a tool built by engineers for engineers. You will work on features that impact thousands of customers globally and have the ability to change how applications are built across all parts of the stack. You’ll meet with internal counterparts to enhance customer thinking and partner closely with product on building out features. You’ll have a large impact on new features or improve performance on thousands of customers' applications.\n\nRetool is built primarily in JavaScript and TypeScript, Node.js on the backend, and React on the frontend. We’ll look to you to bring your experience to build within this environment and impact our codebase. You’ll also engage in technical decision-making with the team, participate in planning, and help our engineering team expand its skillset. To that end, you’ll also play a key role in helping us grow the team through interviewing potential new team members.\n\nWHO YOU'LL WORK WITH\n\nAs an engineer, you will work closely with product and design teams to build, ship, and iterate new features. We’re a hard-working, passionate bunch who are motivated by collaboration, strong results, and bringing the impact of Retool to our customers. When we’re in the office, we enjoy eating lunch (and occasionally dinner!) together, and we’ve been known for our lively game nights. But at the root of it all, we come together to show our customers and not-quite-yet customers how Retool can make them and their companies more efficient and successful. If this sounds like a fit, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nIN THIS ROLE YOU'LL\n\n• Improve the UX of the Retool core editor, which involves plenty of interesting problems, both technical (e.g. \"how do we implement our drag and drop system in a performant way?\") and otherwise (e.g. \"how do we handle the pushing of existing components when dragging new components on?\")\n• Expand the types of applications that you can build into different parts of the development process\n• Debug customer problems + build features for them (e.g. \"the Google Sheets integration doesn't support adding rows\", and \"what's the best way to support that? Via cell ranges, or via a lightweight, home-grown ORM?\")\n• Help assess and recruit future engineers\n• Work on increasing the scalability of Retool’s platform (e.g. frontend application performance, reducing query latencies)\n\nTHE SKILLSET YOU'LL BRING\n\n• 6+ years experience in professional software development, ideally some of which you’ve spent in startups\n• Experience owning technically challenging and demanding cross-functional projects\n• Experience across the entire stack, from backend to frontend (and if you have a preference, we’d love to hear it!)\n• Experience with cloud based infrastructure like Azure, AWS or GCP\n• Ability to make technical decisions quickly, while looping in key stakeholders, too\n• A customer-first mindset and an interest in talking with customers to make sure what we’re building meets their needs\n• Habit of introspection and understanding what’s helped you be successful in the past\n\nNICE TO HAVE\n\n• Experience in JavaScript / TypeScript\n• Experience with PostgreSQL\n• Bonus points if you have experience in mentoring other team members, and have previously worked closely with designers\n\nRetool offers generous benefits to all employees. For more information, please visit the benefits and perks section of our careers page!\n\nAt this time, Retool is only set up to employ in the US and UK.",

We also have a number of Employee Resource Groups that provide spaces to discuss, share, and reflect on topics that impact us both inside and outside of work - from being new to SaaS or navigating it as a first-time parent, to overcoming the barriers faced as Black, Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, LGBTQIA or other underrepresented backgrounds.\n\nWe are also passionate about the connections we build with our customers.

There is a virtuous cycle between profitability and sustainability in many natural resource industries, especially agriculture. Better soil health, water conservation, and climate resilience often leads to lower costs, increased yields, and price premiums for crops or livestock in the market. To reduce the upfront cost and knowledge barriers to implementing these practices, we are tackling an overlooked part of the operation: back office paperwork and financials. There’s tremendous room for improvement on existing software and time-consuming paperwork shuffling in the farm back office. Over time, we’ll expand beyond agriculture to drive sustainable practices in other natural resource industries: fisheries, forestry, water, energy, mining, and more.\n\nWe’re a Series A startup backed by top investors (Thrive Capital, Homebrew, Designer Fund, BoxGroup, and more) and are looking for mission- and values-aligned individuals to join our fully remote founding team.\n\nLearn more about our mission and what it’s like to work with us.\n\nThe opportunity\n\nAmbrook is building a world-class team.
